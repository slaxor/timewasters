Collatz
=======
This is an extension for Fixnum, that returns an Array with all numbers Collatz from
[Collatz Conjecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture). I find it doubtful
that it could be of use for anyone. But you can go hunting for a number that doesnÂ´t
end with the wondrous triplet [...,4,2,1].
